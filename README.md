#Current Thoughts on Some Questionable Hacks from DW

Ok so guys, I have a few hacks that I'm kind of iffy about including. I have reasons for all of them:

- Overwhelm/Unyielding. These are in the same routine as the new fury hack, which means they may conflict. I also don't really like the concept of them much, since they don't really affect much.

- Old Oil. I have no idea what FFM was thinking but I'm pretty sure there's errors in there. I'd have to actually test it on mednafen though.

- Desperation. I've mentioned multiple times that I don't really like the way I coded this at all, because of its clunky nature. Also, I feel like it could be funner for players to use a skill that impacts most damage and healing rather than just weapons. It would be relatively simpler to code that too.

- Luck Up. I've always felt that this could be better handled because it literally depends on a previously existing hack in Arena that I guess we don't have. I don't know where the individual skill/weapon proc ASM is but I'm sure we can find it. Also, I'd like to bundle it with that hack when I get the chance to.

- Gil Toss formula. What a waste of a formula slot. Players can't really take advantage of it too easily anyway and I don't really like the skill much. This would require some discussion but we will need to decide if it stays.

- Cover Fire formula. Ahhhhhh my brain hurts I still can't wrap my mind around it! Can I code something simpler PLEASE? I really don't like random damage formulas, they get on my nerves when I'm trying to debug them lol.
